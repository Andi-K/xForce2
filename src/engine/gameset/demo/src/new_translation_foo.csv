It can have up to 7 subterran layers and a surface layer.\nIf you build a new base it will always consist of the surface layer and 1 subsurface layer. Protect your bases at all costs, for you will loose the game if your last base is destroyed!\nFor each level you dig down, the structures build there will take less damage from attacking UFOs.\nBuildings on the surface (including the elevator) take full damage and for each layer the damage is reduced by 50%.

Without workers it will only produce at [b]~10% efficiency[/b].\nYou can create quarters, recruit workers and send them to work in the mine to increase output. In a mine you may only build storages and defence buildings. "
