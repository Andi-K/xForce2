# X-Force 2
A game engine for round based tactic games.

It is a rewrite of [X-Force:FFD] using the [Godot Engine]

> X-Force:FFD is a game in the style of the old classics UFO: Enemy Unknown, XCOM: Terror from the Deep and XCOM: Apocalypse, where the player defended the earth with a military organization against an invasion from outer space. These classic weres at their time a unique mixture of research, strategy and tactics -- a mixture which hasn't been imitated very often since then.
> 
> The implementing of all game aspects by gamesets and the gameset studio is the great strength of X-Force. Every interested gameset creator can provide all players with his own history and story, including new aliens and science projects.

X-Force 2 will increase the strength of X-Force: FFD and provide more flexibility for gameset creators.
Thus, it is not limited to "Humans vs Aliens" games.
