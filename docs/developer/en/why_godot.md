# Why Godot?

  - Open Source
  - It's small but powerful and flexible.
  - "old but up-to-date" it was used for 64 Bit and multi-touch support
  - GD-Script is easy to learn, Non-programmers can do some parts without any Line of Code while experts can use C++.
    I think this is great for a understaffed Fan-made Game.
  - We can use real 3D Models made with Blender and old 2D Sprites side by side.
  - It make it easy to support native Linux & Windows. Later we can support Mac OS and Andriod, perhaps Firefox OS/HTML5 too

## Why not â€¦ ?
  - **FiFe** looks very useful but i fear it's a dead end.
    Still based on Python 2.6 and SDL1 and no 64 Bit Windows support.
    The Map-Editor is broken, the "next Release is coming soon!" announcement is 2 years old.
  - **Unity 3D** is popular but closed Source (alike Delphi)
    no stable Editor (IDE) for Linux (~~well "In-progress" since 2011, no ETA for a "early experimental build"~~ Alpha is out)
    supposed to have a higher learning curve then Godot.
  - **C++ & QT + Python**
    We bite off too much if we build every thing *from scratch*.
    We can use C++ to extend Godot and GD-Script is much like Python anyhow.
    QT 5.5 use a lot of disk space
  - **Rust & Piston**
    I like to use Rust but it's still a long way to be a solid base and too much work for us as well.
